# Lepton_Fakerate

The input ntuples are produced using mudole https://github.com/ExtraYukawa/ttc_bar/blob/lep_mvaID/modules/FakeRateProducer.py, in which the leptons id and corresponding selections are defined.

The QCD.py is used for MC closuretest, and mu_fr.py/ele_fr.py is used for nominal fakerate calculation.
